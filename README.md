### Checkout Times 

[August Peak Hours for Checkout]

* Highest activity hours are from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM and require the most resources mobilized.
* The activity from 2:00 AM to 5:00 AM is low so this would be the window for bike maintenance.

[Checkout times for users] 

[Checkout times by gender}

* Male users take approximately 3 times more rides than the female users.
* 

### Trips by Gender on Weekdays

[trips map showing who uses the bikes on weekdays]

* Most weekday rides are around 7:00 AM to 9 AM and 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM.
* Weekend rides are highest from 10:00 AM to 7:00 PM.
* Those rides are mostly taken by male users.

### Starting and Ending Locations 

[Top Starting Locations}
{Top Ending Locations]

* There were over 2.3 million rides for the month of August 2019.
*81% of the users were subscribers. 65% of the users were confirmed males and 25% were confirmed females.
* There is a wide range of the age of the users. Younger users tend to use the service for longer rides.
* Top ride starting locations are in the most touristic and busy areas, as we see here in Manhattan.


## Summary: 
The visualizations show high activity of the bike sharing service in New York City in August 2019.
Most of the rides were in the Manhattan Island area, taken by male users during morning and evening rush hours. This implies that Citi Bike services are used as an alternative to public transportation by commuting workers.

Additional analysis would be beneficial if we could get data to:
* Compare all months to determine trends across the year,
* include weather data to find the correlation between the weather and the rides.
* wee if the results have changed now that we have survived COVID and many workers now work from home. Do people still use bikes to commute to jobs?
